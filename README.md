# TensorflowExamples

In this git repository are stored different NN Architecture written in Tensorflow. For now it contains:

- NN w 1 Linear Layer
- CNN
- RNN built from scratch
- RNN built with Tensorflow module
- LSTM with embedding
- Autoencoder with Keras

The code is taken from the the book "Learning TensorFlow: A Guide to Building Deep Learning Systems"
